## Project Title
#### Udacity Landing Page Project

## Development
1. I downloaded the initial source code from udacity's github repository mentioned in the course.
2. I made minor changes to the HTML file to setup my coding in JavaScript.
3. I made a few additions to the CSS file.
4. I tried to use everything I learned during the entire JavaScript and DOM manipulation course.
5. I then completed the requirements for the project in terms of making the landing page dynamic.

## Contributors
#### contributors to my work are ofcourse Udacity's team for providing initial HTML and CSS code, and Mohamed Nasif, a person I don't know but found his code for this project on github and it was very useful for me to develope my skills and to understand exactly what I have to do in this project.
